### Understanding Maximum Edge Weights of a Vertex in Graphs

The maximum edge weights of a vertex refers to the sum of weights of all edges connected to a particular vertex in a weighted graph. It's an important metric used to identify vertices that have the most significant influence or importance in terms of weight-based connectivity within a network.

#### Maximum Edge Weights in Undirected Graphs

In an undirected graph, edges don't have a direction - they simply connect two vertices bidirectionally. The key properties of maximum edge weights calculation in undirected graphs are:

1. **Edge Counting**: Each edge connecting vertex v to any other vertex is counted exactly once.
2. **Weight Consideration**: The weight of each edge is added to the sum for both vertices it connects.
3. **Adjacency Matrix Representation**: For vertex v, we sum all weights in row v (or equivalently column v) of the adjacency matrix.
4. **Adjacency List Representation**: For vertex v, we sum the weights of all edges in its adjacency list.

For example, in Task2a.java, the implementation calculates this as:
```java
public static int vertexWithMaxSum(int[][] adjMatrix) {
    int maxSum = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
    int vertex = -1;

    for (int i = 0; i < adjMatrix.length; i++) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j < adjMatrix[i].length; j++) {
            sum += adjMatrix[i][j];
        }
        if (sum > maxSum) {
            maxSum = sum;
            vertex = i;
        }
    }
    return vertex;
}
```

#### Maximum Edge Weights in Directed Graphs

In a directed graph, edges have a specific direction from one vertex to another. This fundamentally changes how the maximum edge weights are calculated:

1. **Outgoing vs. Incoming Edges**: We must distinguish between outgoing edges (from the vertex) and incoming edges (to the vertex).
2. **Calculation Options**:
    - **Outgoing Edges Only**: Sum only the weights of edges that start from the vertex (as implemented in Task3).
    - **Incoming Edges Only**: Sum only the weights of edges that end at the vertex.
    - **Both**: Sum the weights of all connected edges (not commonly used).

In Task3, the implementation specifically considers only outgoing edges:
```java
public static int vertexMaxWeightSum(int[][] adjMatrix) {
    int maxSum = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
    int vertex = -1;

    for (int i = 0; i < adjMatrix.length; i++) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j < adjMatrix[i].length; j++) {
            sum += adjMatrix[i][j]; // Only summing weights in row i (outgoing edges)
        }
        if (sum > maxSum) {
            maxSum = sum;
            vertex = i;
        }
    }
    return vertex;
}
```

#### Key Differences Between Directed and Undirected Graphs

1. **Edge Consideration**:
    - In undirected graphs, the weight of an edge between vertices u and v contributes to the weight sum of both u and v.
    - In directed graphs, the weight of an edge from u to v contributes only to the outgoing weight sum of u (or the incoming weight sum of v, depending on what you're measuring).

2. **Matrix Symmetry**:
    - Undirected graph adjacency matrices are symmetric (adjMatrix[i][j] = adjMatrix[j][i]), so the sum of any row equals the sum of the corresponding column.
    - Directed graph adjacency matrices are generally not symmetric, so the sum of a row (outgoing edges) is usually different from the sum of the corresponding column (incoming edges).

3. **Adjacency List Structure**:
    - In undirected graphs, if vertex v is in the adjacency list of u, then u is also in the adjacency list of v.
    - In directed graphs, if vertex v is in the adjacency list of u (meaning u â†’ v), u might not appear in the adjacency list of v.

4. **Semantic Meaning**:
    - In undirected graphs, the maximum edge weight sum identifies vertices with the strongest overall connectivity.
    - In directed graphs considering only outgoing edges, it identifies vertices that have the strongest influence on other vertices.
    - In directed graphs considering only incoming edges, it identifies vertices that are most influenced by other vertices.

5. **Implementation Implications**:
    - When converting from directed to undirected (as in Task4), we ensure edge weights are consistently represented in both directions, potentially changing the maximum weight vertex.

Understanding these differences is crucial when analyzing network properties, centrality measures, and solving graph-based problems that involve weighted connections between entities.
