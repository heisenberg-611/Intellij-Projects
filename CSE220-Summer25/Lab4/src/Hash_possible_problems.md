### Hash Table Problem Analysis

Based on the files in your project, I can see that your university course (CSE220-Summer25) is covering hash tables with different implementations and requirements. Here's an analysis of the hash-related problems you're likely to encounter:

#### Common Hash Table Problem Types

1. **Hash Function Implementation**
   - All three implementations (UngradedTasks, LabTasks, AssignmentTasks) require you to implement a `hashFunction()` method
   - Different implementations use different key types:
     - UngradedTasks: String keys
     - LabTasks: String keys
     - AssignmentTasks: Integer keys
   - You'll need to understand how to create effective hash functions for different data types

2. **Collision Resolution**
   - All implementations use chaining (linked lists) for collision resolution
   - You'll need to understand how to:
     - Add nodes to the beginning of chains (prepend)
     - Traverse chains to find specific elements

3. **Basic Operations**
   - Different implementations focus on different operations:
     - UngradedTasks: Implementing `searchHashtable()` to find elements
     - LabTasks: Implementing `insert()` to add elements
     - AssignmentTasks: Implementing `remove()` to delete elements

4. **Node Implementation**
   - Each implementation has a different node class:
     - UngradedTasks: `PairNode` with String key and Integer value
     - LabTasks: `FruitNode` with Object array containing name and price
     - AssignmentTasks: `PairNode` with Integer key and String value

#### What to Expect in University Hash Problems

Based on these patterns, you can expect your university to give you problems that:

1. **Require different hash function implementations**
   - Simple modulo-based hash functions
   - String-based hash functions (possibly using character values)
   - More complex hash functions to minimize collisions

2. **Test your understanding of collision handling**
   - Chaining (linked list implementation)
   - Possibly other methods like linear probing, quadratic probing, or double hashing

3. **Focus on core hash table operations**
   - Insertion with collision handling
   - Searching for elements
   - Deletion of elements (which is more complex with chaining)
   - Possibly rehashing when load factor increases

4. **Vary the key-value types**
   - String keys with numeric values
   - Numeric keys with string values
   - Possibly more complex object keys

5. **Test edge cases**
   - Handling null values
   - Handling duplicates
   - Handling non-existent keys (for search/remove)
   - Handling hash table resizing

The progression from UngradedTasks to LabTasks to AssignmentTasks shows increasing complexity, with the final assignment focusing on the more challenging operation of removing elements from a hash table with chaining.

### Key Concepts to Master

1. Hash function design principles
2. Collision resolution techniques
3. Time complexity analysis of hash operations
4. Load factor and its impact on performance
5. Handling edge cases in hash table operations

By understanding these patterns, you should be well-prepared for the types of hash table problems your university will assign in this course.
