### Project Analysis: Graph Algorithms Implementation

This project consists of multiple Java files implementing various graph algorithms and data structures. The implementation demonstrates different graph representations and operations organized into several tasks.

### Core Data Structure

**EdgeNode.java**
- Defines a node class for linked list representation of edges in a graph
- Contains: destination vertex (toV), edge weight, and reference to next edge
- Used in adjacency list implementation of graphs

### Task Implementations

#### Task0: Graph Representation Basics

**Task0a.java**
- Creates an adjacency matrix for an undirected graph
- Defines a graph with 7 vertices (0-6) and various edges
- Sets matrix[i][j] = matrix[j][i] = 1 for each edge to represent an undirected graph

#### Task1: Adjacency List and Degree Calculation

**Task1.java**
- Implements adjacency list representation using linked lists
- Includes methods:
    - addEdge: adds an edge to the adjacency list
    - appendLL: appends a new edge node to a linked list
    - maxDegree: finds the maximum degree of any vertex in the graph
- Creates a 5-vertex graph and demonstrates the methods

#### Task2: Finding Vertex with Maximum Weight Sum

**Task2a.java** (Adjacency Matrix Implementation)
- Finds vertex with maximum sum of edge weights in a graph
- Uses adjacency matrix representation
- The `vertexWithMaxSum` method calculates sum of weights for each vertex
- Demonstrates on a weighted undirected graph (symmetric matrix)

**Task2b.java** (Adjacency List Implementation)
- Same functionality as Task2a but uses adjacency list representation
- Traverses the linked list for each vertex to calculate weight sums
- Explicitly adds edges in both directions to represent an undirected graph

#### Task3: Maximum Degree and Weight in Directed Graphs

**Task3a.java** (Adjacency Matrix Implementation)
- Finds vertices with:
    1. Maximum out-degree (most outgoing edges)
    2. Maximum sum of outgoing edge weights
- Uses adjacency matrix representation of directed weighted graph
- Demonstrates on a 5-vertex directed graph

**Task3b.java** (Adjacency List Implementation)
- Same functionality as Task3a but uses adjacency list representation
- Traverses linked lists to find:
    1. Vertex with maximum out-degree
    2. Vertex with maximum sum of outgoing weights
- Demonstrates on a directed weighted graph

#### Task4: Converting Directed to Undirected Graphs

**Task4a.java** (Adjacency Matrix Implementation)
- Converts a directed graph to undirected by symmetrizing the adjacency matrix
- For each edge (i→j), ensures the reverse edge (j→i) exists with the same weight
- Demonstrates the conversion with before/after matrix printouts

**Task4b.java** (Adjacency List Implementation)
- Same functionality as Task4a but for adjacency list representation
- More complex implementation requiring:
    1. Checking if reverse edges exist
    2. Adding missing reverse edges
- Includes helper functions to check for edge existence

### Common Patterns

1. **Dual Implementation Approach**:
    - Each task (except Task0 and Task1) is implemented using two different graph representations:
        - Adjacency matrix (Task#a files)
        - Adjacency list (Task#b files)
    - This demonstrates the tradeoffs between the representations

2. **Code Organization**:
    - Tasks are progressively more complex
    - Functions are modular and well-defined
    - Main methods serve as demonstrators for the implemented algorithms

3. **Graph Implementations**:
    - Adjacency matrices: 2D arrays where matrix[i][j] = weight of edge from i to j
    - Adjacency lists: Arrays of linked lists where each vertex has a list of its neighbors

4. **Graph Types**:
    - Tasks 0-2 focus on undirected graphs
    - Task3 focuses on directed graphs
    - Task4 demonstrates conversion between directed and undirected graphs

### Summary

This project provides a comprehensive exploration of graph data structures and common operations. It implements:
1. Different graph representations (adjacency matrix and list)
2. Fundamental graph properties (degree, weight sums)
3. Directed and undirected graph handling
4. Graph transformation operations

The dual implementation approach for each task allows comparison between adjacency matrix and adjacency list representations, demonstrating their respective strengths and weaknesses for different operations.
